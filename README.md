## Welcome to Strikingly Interview Test


# INTRODUCTION

This test is based on the famous Hangman Game. Your task is to write a program to play Hangman, guessing words from our server through a REST API.

## Requirements
1. Write a program according to the following specifications. When you're happy with your score, submit your score to us.
2. Email us your finished program! Be sure to include a Readme.txt explaining the cool things you did.
3. You may use ANY computer programming language that you are familiar with. It could be JAVA, PHP, RUBY, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, C, C++, C#, bash...... ( you name it). 
4. You can use ANY libraries relevant for this task.

## Our Expectations
Through this programming test, you should be able to demostrate:

1. Good understanding on the programming language you are good at.
2. Good programming practices
3. Apply suitable algorithms to solve problems
4. Creativity!

## Program Flow and Sepecification
The overall workflow is in 5 stages, namely "Initiate Game", "Give Me A Word", "Make A Guess", "Get Test Results" & "Submit Test Results"
You can play and submit as many times as you want, but we only store the LATEST submitted score. When you're satisfied with your score, don't submit any more!

1. **Initite Game**
  - You send a request to the system to initiate a game
  - The URL of the system could be found in your invitation email
	- Get a secret key from the system and include this key in the following communications. This key identifies the game session!
	- Request & Response
		* Request:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"action" : "initiateGame",
				"userId" : "test@test.com"
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation: 
			1. "action" key should have the value for "initiateGame"
			2. "userId" key should be your email address, shown on your invitation email. please contact joyce@strikingly.com if you find your email address is invalid in this programming test.

		* Response:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"message":"Welcome To Strikingly Interview Test!",
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F",
				"status":200,
				"data":
				{
					"numberOfWordsToGuess":80,
					"numberOfGuessAllowedForEachWord":10
				}
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation: 
			1. "message" always tells you a human readable message. The message in this response is a welcome message.
			2. "userId" shows your email address
			3. "secret" gives you a secret for the follwing communication. This secret key identifies each game you play.
			4. "status" tells you the status of your request. It follows the standard HTTP Status Code. 200 - OK, 400 - Bad Request, 401 - Unauthenticated
			5. "data" contains some useful data for your reference. In the "initiateGame" response, 
				"numberOfWordsToGuess" - tells you how many words you will have to guess to finish the game.
				"numberOfGuessAllowedForEachWord" - tells you how many INCORRECT guess you may have for each word.

2. **Give Me A Word**
	- After getting the secret key, you can ask the system to give you a word
	- Remember to include BOTH your "userId" and "secret", and put the correct "action" as "nextWord"
	- In the response you will have "word" in the JSON. The "*" indicates the characters that you have to guess in a word. The number "*" in the word key tells you the number of charaters in a word.
	- What kinds of Words will appear in the game? please read [Words](https://github.com/kangbiu/strikingly-interview-test-instructions/edit/master/README.md#words) section 
	- Request & Response
		* Request:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"action":"nextWord",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F"
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation:
			1. "userId" should be your email address
			2. "action" should be "nextWord"
			3. "secret" should be the secret in the reponse from "initateGame"

		* Response:
			<pre><code> 
			{		
				"word":"*****",
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F",
				"status":200,
				"data":
					{
						"numberOfWordsTried":1,
						"numberOfGuessAllowedForThisWord":10
					}
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation:
			1. "word" contains the "*". A "*" sign indicate a missing character in a word
			2. "data" 
				* "numberOfWordsTried" - tells you the number of words that you have tried.
				* "numberOfGuessAllowedForThisWord" - tells you the number of guess you can have on this word. When the number is 0 and you still can't get the correct word, then this word will be counted as incorrect and you have to get a new word.
			3. "userId", "secret", "status" - explained in Response section of "Initite Game"

3. **Make A Guess**
	- You can make a guess on those characters shown as "*" in a word
	- You can only guess ONE character per request, i.e. "guess":"P". **NOTE**: The system will treat two characters or more as WRONG guess.
	- Let's say the word - "*****" is indeed "HAPPY". If the your character does exist in the word, then the response will return you the character in the corresponding positions of the word, i.e. "word": "**PP*"
	- But if your guess is incorrect, then it will return you the same word. Say you make your next guess as "guess":"K" and "K" does NOT exist in "HAPPY", you will get the response as "**PP*"
	- If you get the "word" without any "*", then it means you get the word correct. for instance, "word":"HAPPY". And you can then get a new word by sending "Give A Word" request
	- Request & Response
		* Request:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"action":"guessWord",
				"guess":"P",
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F"
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation:
			1. "action" should be "guessWord"
			2. "guess" is the character that you think should exist in the word. IMPORTATN: only accept CAPITAL Letter
			3. "userId" & "secret" - same previouse request. you MUST include these two fields

		* Response:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"word":"**PP*",
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F",
				"status":200,
				"data":
				{
					"numberOfWordsTried":1,
					"numberOfGuessAllowedForThisWord":10
				}
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation:
			1. "word" is updated to "**PP*" because "P" exist in "HAPPY"
			2. "data" 
				* "numberOfWordsTried" - tells you the number of words that you have tried.
				* "numberOfGuessAllowedForThisWord" - tells you the number of guess you can have on this word. When the number is 0 and you still can't get the correct word, then this word will be counted as incorrect and you have to get a new word.
			3. "userId", "secret", "status" - explained in Response section of "Initite Game"

4. **Get Test Results**
	- You can get your results only when you have finished guess all the 80 words
	- You get your results by sending a request with "action":"getTestResults"
	- Request & Response:
		* Request:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"action":"getTestResults",
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F"
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation:
			1. "action" should be "getTestResults"
			3. "userId" & "secret" - same previouse request. you MUST include these two fields
		
		* Response:
			<pre><code>
			{
				"message":"Please check your results! Submit the results if you are happy with it!",
				"userId":"test@test.com",
				"secret":"2V2GUB00590H33DIEMH24V9V03PU8F",
				"status":200,
				"data":
				{
					"numberOfWordsTried":80,
					"numberOfCorrectWords":50,
					"numberOfWrongGuesses":300,
					"totalScore": 700
				}
			}
			</code></pre>

			Explanation:
			1. "message" tells you a readable message which 
			2. "userId", "secret", "status" - explained in Response section of "Initite Game"
			3. "data" - your results! 
				* "numberOfWordsTried" - the total number of words you tried in this game.
				* "numberOfCorrectWords" - the total number of words you guess correctly 
				* "numberOfWrongGuesses" - the total number of Wrong guess you have made. That is the "guessWord" you made but incorrect.
				* "totalScore" - the total score is calculated. The higher the totalScore, the better results! 
					- totalScore = numberOfCorrectWord * 20 - numberOfWrongGuess.

## Tips:
Use a Chrome extension to simulate send request and get response in order to familiar with yourself with the flow

## Q&A
1. Can I skip a word?
	Yes! send another "Give Me A Word" request, i.e. "action":"nextWord"

2. Can you submit mulitple results?
	Yes and No! You can submit your test results as many times as you want. BUT we ONLY store your LATEST submission.

3. Can I always inititate a new game?
	Yes! you can always initiate a new game and play the game again and again. BUT always remember to submit your results if you are happy with your performance on a certain game.
